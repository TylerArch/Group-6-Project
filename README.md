# Group 6 Project 1 Movie Watchlist Creator


## Description
The motivation for this project was to create a  interactive movie search from an existing API that allows the user to create a custom movie playlist.For this project we incorporated the use of APIs, HTML and Bootstrap, CSS, javascript, jQuery, and glide.js.

## Installation

Right clicking on the index.html and selecting "Open in default browser" will open the browser and  navigate to the main search page page. 

## Usage

From the main page you can search for a movie and the results will display below. You are able to add multiple movies to your playlist and also see previous searches you have done. Clicking the link to go to "My Playlist" will take you to the second page with the selected movies.  The titles glide left to right on the screen and hovering over a movie stops this effect. You also have the option to return to the "search" screen.
